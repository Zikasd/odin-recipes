        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nicely spiced with cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin, this bread is moist and delicious! Makes 1 loaf or 18 muffins.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup raisins</li>
            <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 cup pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place raisins in a bowl and pour in boiling water to cover by 1 inch. Allow to sit until raisins are plump and rehydrated, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain raisins, and reserve 1/3 cup of the soaking water in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Combine pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, reserved soaking water, and oil in another bowl; mix with a spoon or whisk until well combined. Stir pumpkin mixture into flour mixture until just moistened. Fold in walnuts and raisins. Pour batter into a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes then transfer to a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
