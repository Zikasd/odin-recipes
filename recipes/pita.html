        <h1>Apple Curry Turkey Pita</h1>
        <img src="../images/pita.jpg" alt="Pita"> 
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>is great for turkey leftovers. Simple, quick and flavorful. This is a good one for substitutions too. I've used white wine in place of lemon, sour cream in place of yogurt, chicken in place of turkey and Indian naan in place of the pita. Enjoy!</p>
